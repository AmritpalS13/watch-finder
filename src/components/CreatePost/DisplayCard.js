  const tempdesc = "The release of the new Seiko 5 Sports line, cleverly nicknamed the 5KX (due to its resemblance to the very popular and now discontinued SKX line) was met with a mixed response. The new line includes a hacking and handwinding movement. However, it also lost some important specifications of its predecessor. These include a screw down crown, 200m water resistance, a lume pip on the bezel, and ISO certification. At the same time, the MSRP of this watch was just about $300 (although we have seen the price of this line slowly fall over time). To many, this was less watch at a higher price, which has been a theme for Seiko as of late.Enter the Orient Kamasu. While the MSRP of this watch is $460, they are usually available for between $200 â€“ $300. With a hacking and handwinding movement, 200 meters of water resistance, a screw-down crown, and a sapphire crystal, the Orient Kamasu is a killer value proposition that has all of the specifications many hoped for in the new 5XK line (perhaps falling only short of ISO certification)";
